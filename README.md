# ML-Regression-Methods-Comparison-with-Wine-Quality-Dataset
ML Regression/Prediction Model Comparison using Red Wine Quality Data Set from UCI. The goal is to model red wine quality based on physicochemical tests. 

This notebook would implement the follwing machine learning methods:

1. Logistic Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Neural Networks: we will use Multi-layer perceptron.

Response Variable: field used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease (value = 2), or no disease (value = 1))

## Our goal is to train a machine learning model to predict the quality score of the wine given phyicochemical information of it

1. Input variables (based on physicochemical tests): fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol

2 Output variable (based on sensory data): quality (score between 0 and 10)
